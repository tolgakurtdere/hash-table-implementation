Data Structures | Hash table implementation by C++

In this hash table, for every possible key in the table, stored at most 3 values, called a bucket. If
the bucket for a key is used, then the hash table should use the standard open addressing (quadratic probing) to find
the next bucket for that key. Note that in a bucket, I searched the entries linearly, did not iterate in the bucket
quadratically.
